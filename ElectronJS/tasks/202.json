Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she \ntakes a shower.\nRoger: That's pretty much it.\nPhoebe: Oops!\nRoger: But you tell it really well, sweetie.\nPhoebe: Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.\nRoger: Okay. I'll miss you.\nPhoebe: Isn't he great?\nRachel: He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.\nPhoebe: I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a \nshrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?\nMonica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?\nPhoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, \ny'know? Vinyl.\nRachel: Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want \nanything else?\nChandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)\nRachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?\nChandler: Okay.\nRoger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?\nChandler: No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.\nRoss: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?\nChandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a \ntelescope and a box of donuts.\nRachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?\nPhoebe: Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her \nbreasts.\nRachel: Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.\nMonica: Hey \nI always liked ‘bazoombas.’  Gives them a Latin spin.\nRachel:  \nCan we please not talk about it, please?\nChandler: Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were \nvery nice boobies.\nRachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are \nnice.\nChandler: Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.\nRoger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there \nwhen when the laughter stops.\nChandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?\nRoger: Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. \nY'know, that you use your humor as a way of keeping people at a distance.\nChandler: Huh.\nRoger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only \nchild, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.\nChandler: Uh-huh, how did you know that?\nRoger: It's textbook.\n(Joey enters with his dad)\nJoey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?\nAll: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!\nMonica: Hey, how long are you in the city?\nMr. Tribbiani: Just for a couple of days. I got a job midtown. I \nfigure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on \nthe ferry. (Sees Roger) I don't know this one.\nPhoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger.\nRoger: Hi. \nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.\nRoger: You too, sir.\nMr. Tribbiani: (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?\nJoey: Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross \nwhines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, \nChandler, quick, say something funny!\n(Chandler stays stone faced)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]\nMr. Tribbiani: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting \nreal late now\nJoey: (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with \nDr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?\n(His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms)\nMr. Tribbiani: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. \nJoey: Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)\nMr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you \nto the navy yard and show you the big ships?\nJoey: Since then?!\nMr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a \nnice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.\n(Joey starts chopping garlic) What are you doing?\nJoey: \nChopping garlic.\nMr. Tribianni: \nYou’re not going to crush it?\n\n\nJoey: Hey, \nyou’re having an affair. I’m chopping garlic. It’s a wacky world.\nMr. Tribianni: Joe. You ever been in love?\nJoey: ...I don’t know.\nMr. Tribbiani: Then you haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.\nJoey: You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)\nMr. Tribbiani: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of \nit is, it's with two different women.\nJoey: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.\nMr. Tribbiani: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter \nwith you?\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's \naffair.]\nJoey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was \nleading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. \n(Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!\nMonica: (to \nRoss) Do you ever think dad cheated on mom?\nRoss: Oh \nno. I don’t think so. ‘Cause that would involve having sex, and I would like to \nthink that our parents don’t do that sort of thing.\n\n\n(The oven timer goes off. Monica gets up.)\nRachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She \nwalks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do \nthey have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you \nstop staring at my breasts?\nChandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?\nRachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?\nRoss: All right, all right. We're all adults here, there's only one \nway to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have \nto show her your pee pee.\nChandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?\nRachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.\nChandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'\n(Door buzzer goes)\nMonica: Hello?\nPhoebe: (Intercom) It's Phoebe.\nRoger: (Intercom) And Rog.\nMonica: C'mon up.\nChandler: (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.\nJoey: What's the matter with Rog?\nRoss: Yeah.\nChandler: Oh, it's nothing; it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\nRoss: What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? \nC'mon, he's not that bad.\n(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)\nRoss: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I \nthought on any level that-that she was a lesbian?\nRoger: I don’t know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.\nRoss: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?\nRoger: I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to \ncompensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...\nMonica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.\nRoger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to \nsabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the \neyes of the parents.\nRoss: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!\nMonica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!\nPhoebe: Isn't he good?\nRoss: Nonono, that-that's not what I was saying...\nMonica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But \nmaybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking \nyou better!\nRoss: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!\n(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)\nRachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, \nbut it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which \nhad this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. \nAnd-and mom just gave it all away.\n\n\nRoger: That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch \nthat movie, we gotta get going. \nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?\nRoger: Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...\nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.\nMonica: You're welcome.\nRoger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on \nthose cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.\n(He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)\nMonica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)\n[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]\nJoey: Night, you guys.\n(They notice that a woman is sitting by their door)\nChandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\nJoey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?\nRonni: Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.\nJoey: I'm Joey Tribbiani.\nRonni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than \nyour pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?\nChandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not \naround.]\nRonni: Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em \nsort of laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who \nwants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping \nto catch a Frisbee.\nChandler: Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.\nRonni: (laughing) That's a good one!\n(Joey's dad enters.)\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, Joe.\nJoey: Dad, Ronni's here.\nMr. Tribbiani: Huh?\nRonni: Hi.\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh-what're what're you doing here?\nRonni: Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment; I \nfigured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)\nMr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...\nChandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\nRonni: Look, I uh, I shouldn't have come. I-I'd better get going, I \ndon't wanna miss the last train.\nMr. Tribbiani: I don't want you taking that thing.\nRonni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?\nJoey: Who-ah-ho.\nMr. Tribbiani: We'll go to a hotel.\nRonni: (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.\nJoey: No you won't.\nRonni: No we won't.\nJoey: If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right \nhere where I can keep an eye on you.\nMr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?\nJoey: That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long \nas you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no \nsleeping with your girlfriend.\nRonni: Wow. He's strict.\nJoey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in \nChandler's room.\nChandler: \n And Chandler will be….?\nJoey:  Out \nhere with me bunking up on the Hide-a-Bed.\nChandler: \nOooh, bunking up. If you smell ‘smores, don’t be alarmed.\nRonni: Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.\nChandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird \nwhen it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\" \nJoey: Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta \nmake a change. Six years is long enough.\nMr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?\nJoey: Well, either you break it off with Ronni\nMr. Tribbiani: I can't do that!\nJoey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!\nMr. Tribbiani: Yeah, but this is\nJoey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the \nHide-a-Bed in the living room. Joey is restless.]\nChandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\nJoey: Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.\n\nChandler: Well, you're gonna.\nJoey: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on \ntop of girls...\nChandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\nJoey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all \nthese women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able \nto be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, \nthinking...\nChandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you \nto go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\nJoey: No.\nChandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. \nNow that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the \nright woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No \nthanks, I'm married.\"\nJoey: You really think so?\nChandler: Yeah. I really do.\nJoey: Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)\nChandler: Get off!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica \ngets it.]\nRonni: Hi.\nMonica: Hi...May I help you?\nRonni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, \nChandler's in ours?\nMonica: Okay...who are you?\nRonni: Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?\nMonica: Oh, c'mon in.\nRonni: Thanks.\nRachel: Hi, I'm Rachel.\nRonni: Hi.\nRachel: Bathroom's up there.\nRonni: Great.\nRachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in \nthe shower?\nRonni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?\nRachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee pee time. (She goes \ninto Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) \nHey, Mr. Trib. \nMr. Tribbiani: Hey. Morning, dear.\n(Rachel goes up to the door of their bathroom)\nRachel: Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.\n(She opens the door and whips back the curtain. It's Joey. They both scream)\nJoey: (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!\nRachel: I thought it was Chandler!\nChandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?\nRachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!\nChandler: Sorry, my, my thing was in there with me.\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\nPhoebe: Hey. \nMonica: How's it going?\nPhoebe: Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to \ninvite you guys.\n(Chandler laughs)\nPhoebe: So what's going on?\nMonica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. \nRoss: I don’t know, there's just something about...\nChandler: Basically we just feel that he's...\nRachel: We hate that guy.\nAll: Yeah. Hate him.\nRoss: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.\nPhoebe: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just \nthat he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?\nAll: ...No, we hate him.\nRachel: We're sorry.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the Hide-a-Bed \nback into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]\nJoey: Ma! What're you doing here?\nMrs. Tribbiani: I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) \nand this. (Whacks him round the ear)\nJoey: Oww! Big ring!\nMrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all \nthat garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! \nThere's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives \nthe Hide-a-Bed a tiny push and it folds away)\nJoey: Hold on, you-you knew?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is \nno James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \"I'm sleeping over \nat my accountant's,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\nJoey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\nMrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always \nyelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that \nwood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! \nI mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.\nJoey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are \nyou talking about?! I mean, what about you?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd \nbe no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something \nelse. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself \nthat he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every \nday's our anniversary.\nJoey: I'm...happy...for you?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I \njust want it the way it was.\nJoey: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.\nMrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell \nme. Did you see her?\nJoey: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.\nMrs. Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?\nJoey: With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Roger enters and walks \nquietly up behind Phoebe. He puts his arm around her]\nPhoebe: \n(frightened) Oh oh! Don’t ever do that! Ever!\nRoger: Why?\nPhoebe: \n I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  Look, I have a thing. I have a thing, which means you \ncan’t ever do that.\nRoger: Why? What's wrong, sweetie?\nPhoebe: Nothing, nothing.\nRoger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and \nrests her head in his lap)\nPhoebe: It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. \nThey-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.\nRoger: Oh. They don't.\nPhoebe: But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They \ndon't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a \nlittle...\nRoger: What?\nPhoebe: Intense and creepy. \nRoger: Oh.\nPhoebe: But I don't. Me, Phoebe.\nRoger: Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.\nPhoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great! \nRoger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behavior when you \nhave this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of \nco-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your \nstupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're \nlike all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new \ndevelopments.]\nMonica: So you talked to your dad, huh.\nJoey: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's \ngonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little \nsister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining \norder...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\nRachel: Wow.\nChandler: Things sure have changed here on Walton’s mountain.\nRoss: So Joey, you okay?\nJoey: Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you \ngotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own \nmistakes.\nRachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\nChandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond \nchasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey.\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\nMonica: How's it going?\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\nAll: Awww.\nPhoebe: Yeah, right.\nAll: Aaawwwwww!!\nRachel: What happened?\nPhoebe: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really \nsweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that \nguy!\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]\nPhoebe: Hey, Joey. What's going on?\nJoey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: \nRachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, \nclosely followed by Monica in a towel)\nMonica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\nJoey: Sorry. Wrong boobies.\n(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks \nup to the shower door)\nMonica: Hello, \nJoey.                                                              \n(She whips back the curtain to reveal Joey's dad)\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh! ...Hello, dear.

So sweet... and so complicated. And for a \nshrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?\nMonica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?\nPhoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, \ny'know? Vinyl.\nRachel: Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want \nanything else?\nChandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)\nRachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?\nChandler: Okay.\nRoger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?\nChandler: No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.\nRoss: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?\nChandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a \ntelescope and a box of donuts.\nRachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?\nPhoebe: Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her \nbreasts.\nRachel: Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.\nMonica: Hey \nI always liked ‘bazoombas.’  Gives them a Latin spin.\nRachel:  \nCan we please not talk about it, please?\nChandler: Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were \nvery nice boobies.\nRachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are \nnice.\nChandler: Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.\nRoger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there \nwhen when the laughter stops.\nChandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?\nRoger: Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. \nY'know, that you use your humor as a way of keeping people at a distance.\nChandler: Huh.\nRoger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only \nchild, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.\nChandler: Uh-huh, how did you know that?\nRoger: It's textbook.\n(Joey enters with his dad)\nJoey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?\nAll: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!\nMonica: Hey, how long are you in the city?\nMr. Tribbiani: Just for a couple of days. I got a job midtown. I \nfigure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on \nthe ferry. (Sees Roger) I don't know this one.\nPhoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger.\nRoger: Hi. \nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.\nRoger: You too, sir.\nMr. Tribbiani: (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?\nJoey: Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross \nwhines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, \nChandler, quick, say something funny!\n(Chandler stays stone faced)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]\nMr. Tribbiani: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting \nreal late now\nJoey: (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with \nDr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?\n(His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms)\nMr. Tribbiani: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. \nJoey: Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)\nMr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you \nto the navy yard and show you the big ships?\nJoey: Since then?!\nMr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a \nnice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.\n(Joey starts chopping garlic) What are you doing?\nJoey: \nChopping garlic.\nMr. Tribianni: \nYou’re not going to crush it?\n\n\nJoey: Hey, \nyou’re having an affair. I’m chopping garlic. It’s a wacky world.\nMr. Tribianni: Joe. You ever been in love?\nJoey: ...I don’t know.\nMr. Tribbiani: Then you haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.\nJoey: You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)\nMr. Tribbiani: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of \nit is, it's with two different women.\nJoey: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.\nMr. Tribbiani: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter \nwith you?\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's \naffair.]\nJoey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was \nleading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. \n(Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!\nMonica: (to \nRoss) Do you ever think dad cheated on mom?\nRoss: Oh \nno. I don’t think so. ‘Cause that would involve having sex, and I would like to \nthink that our parents don’t do that sort of thing.\n\n\n(The oven timer goes off. Monica gets up.)\nRachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She \nwalks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do \nthey have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you \nstop staring at my breasts?\nChandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?\nRachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?\nRoss: All right, all right. We're all adults here, there's only one \nway to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have \nto show her your pee pee.\nChandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?\nRachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.\nChandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'\n(Door buzzer goes)\nMonica: Hello?\nPhoebe: (Intercom) It's Phoebe.\nRoger: (Intercom) And Rog.\nMonica: C'mon up.\nChandler: (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.\nJoey: What's the matter with Rog?\nRoss: Yeah.\nChandler: Oh, it's nothing; it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\nRoss: What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? \nC'mon, he's not that bad.\n(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)\nRoss: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I \nthought on any level that-that she was a lesbian?\nRoger: I don’t know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.\nRoss: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?\nRoger: I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to \ncompensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...\nMonica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.\nRoger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to \nsabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the \neyes of the parents.\nRoss: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!\nMonica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!\nPhoebe: Isn't he good?\nRoss: Nonono, that-that's not what I was saying...\nMonica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But \nmaybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking \nyou better!\nRoss: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!\n(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)\nRachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, \nbut it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which \nhad this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. \nAnd-and mom just gave it all away.\n\n\nRoger: That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch \nthat movie, we gotta get going. \nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?\nRoger: Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...\nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.\nMonica: You're welcome.\nRoger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on \nthose cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.\n(He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)\nMonica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)\n[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]\nJoey: Night, you guys.\n(They notice that a woman is sitting by their door)\nChandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\nJoey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?\nRonni: Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.\nJoey: I'm Joey Tribbiani.\nRonni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than \nyour pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?\nChandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not \naround.]\nRonni: Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em \nsort of laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who \nwants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping \nto catch a Frisbee.\nChandler: Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.\nRonni: (laughing) That's a good one!\n(Joey's dad enters.)\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, Joe.\nJoey: Dad, Ronni's here.\nMr. Tribbiani: Huh?\nRonni: Hi.\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh-what're what're you doing here?\nRonni: Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment; I \nfigured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)\nMr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...\nChandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\nRonni: Look, I uh, I shouldn't have come. I-I'd better get going, I \ndon't wanna miss the last train.\nMr. Tribbiani: I don't want you taking that thing.\nRonni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?\nJoey: Who-ah-ho.\nMr. Tribbiani: We'll go to a hotel.\nRonni: (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.\nJoey: No you won't.\nRonni: No we won't.\nJoey: If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right \nhere where I can keep an eye on you.\nMr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?\nJoey: That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long \nas you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no \nsleeping with your girlfriend.\nRonni: Wow. He's strict.\nJoey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in \nChandler's room.\nChandler: \n And Chandler will be….?\nJoey:  Out \nhere with me bunking up on the Hide-a-Bed.\nChandler: \nOooh, bunking up. If you smell ‘smores, don’t be alarmed.\nRonni: Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.\nChandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird \nwhen it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\" \nJoey: Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta \nmake a change. Six years is long enough.\nMr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?\nJoey: Well, either you break it off with Ronni\nMr. Tribbiani: I can't do that!\nJoey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!\nMr. Tribbiani: Yeah, but this is\nJoey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the \nHide-a-Bed in the living room. Joey is restless.]\nChandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\nJoey: Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.\n\nChandler: Well, you're gonna.\nJoey: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on \ntop of girls...\nChandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\nJoey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all \nthese women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able \nto be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, \nthinking...\nChandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you \nto go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\nJoey: No.\nChandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. \nNow that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the \nright woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No \nthanks, I'm married.\"\nJoey: You really think so?\nChandler: Yeah. I really do.\nJoey: Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)\nChandler: Get off!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica \ngets it.]\nRonni: Hi.\nMonica: Hi...May I help you?\nRonni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, \nChandler's in ours?\nMonica: Okay...who are you?\nRonni: Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?\nMonica: Oh, c'mon in.\nRonni: Thanks.\nRachel: Hi, I'm Rachel.\nRonni: Hi.\nRachel: Bathroom's up there.\nRonni: Great.\nRachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in \nthe shower?\nRonni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?\nRachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee pee time. (She goes \ninto Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) \nHey, Mr. Trib. \nMr. Tribbiani: Hey. Morning, dear.\n(Rachel goes up to the door of their bathroom)\nRachel: Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.\n(She opens the door and whips back the curtain. It's Joey. They both scream)\nJoey: (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!\nRachel: I thought it was Chandler!\nChandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?\nRachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!\nChandler: Sorry, my, my thing was in there with me.\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\nPhoebe: Hey. \nMonica: How's it going?\nPhoebe: Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to \ninvite you guys.\n(Chandler laughs)\nPhoebe: So what's going on?\nMonica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. \nRoss: I don’t know, there's just something about...\nChandler: Basically we just feel that he's...\nRachel: We hate that guy.\nAll: Yeah. Hate him.\nRoss: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.\nPhoebe: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just \nthat he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?\nAll: ...No, we hate him.\nRachel: We're sorry.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the Hide-a-Bed \nback into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]\nJoey: Ma! What're you doing here?\nMrs. Tribbiani: I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) \nand this. (Whacks him round the ear)\nJoey: Oww! Big ring!\nMrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all \nthat garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! \nThere's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives \nthe Hide-a-Bed a tiny push and it folds away)\nJoey: Hold on, you-you knew?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is \nno James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \"I'm sleeping over \nat my accountant's,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\nJoey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\nMrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always \nyelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that \nwood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! \nI mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.\nJoey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are \nyou talking about?! I mean, what about you?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd \nbe no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something \nelse. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself \nthat he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every \nday's our anniversary.\nJoey: I'm...happy...for you?\nMrs. Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I \njust want it the way it was.\nJoey: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.\nMrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell \nme. Did you see her?\nJoey: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.\nMrs. Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?\nJoey: With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Roger enters and walks \nquietly up behind Phoebe. He puts his arm around her]\nPhoebe: \n(frightened) Oh oh! Don’t ever do that! Ever!\nRoger: Why?\nPhoebe: \n I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  Look, I have a thing. I have a thing, which means you \ncan’t ever do that.\nRoger: Why? What's wrong, sweetie?\nPhoebe: Nothing, nothing.\nRoger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and \nrests her head in his lap)\nPhoebe: It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. \nThey-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.\nRoger: Oh. They don't.\nPhoebe: But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They \ndon't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a \nlittle...\nRoger: What?\nPhoebe: Intense and creepy. \nRoger: Oh.\nPhoebe: But I don't. Me, Phoebe.\nRoger: Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.\nPhoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great! \nRoger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behavior when you \nhave this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of \nco-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your \nstupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're \nlike all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new \ndevelopments.]\nMonica: So you talked to your dad, huh.\nJoey: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's \ngonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little \nsister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining \norder...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\nRachel: Wow.\nChandler: Things sure have changed here on Walton’s mountain.\nRoss: So Joey, you okay?\nJoey: Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you \ngotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own \nmistakes.\nRachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\nChandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond \nchasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey.\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\nMonica: How's it going?\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\nAll: Awww.\nPhoebe: Yeah, right.\nAll: Aaawwwwww!!\nRachel: What happened?\nPhoebe: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really \nsweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that \nguy!\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]\nPhoebe: Hey, Joey. What's going on?\nJoey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: \nRachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, \nclosely followed by Monica in a towel)\nMonica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\nJoey: Sorry. Wrong boobies.\n(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks \nup to the shower door)\nMonica: Hello, \nJoey.                                                              \n(She whips back the curtain to reveal Joey's dad)\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh! ...Hello, dear.
